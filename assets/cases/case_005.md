# Case 5: Chronic Low Back 

## Patient Profile
- Name: Alex R.
- Age: 27
- Sex: Male
- Occupation: Graduate student

---

## Chief Complaint
“My lower back and hips feel extremely stiff every morning, and it takes a long time before I can move normally.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **insidious**, beginning approximately **18 months ago**
- No specific injury or trauma
- Primary complaint is **deep stiffness and pain in the low back and pelvis**
- Pain described as dull, deep, and aching (4–6/10)
- Symptoms are:
  - **Worst in the morning**
  - Associated with **stiffness lasting over 90 minutes**
  - **Improve with movement and activity**
  - **Worsen with rest or prolonged sitting**
- Reports **alternating buttock pain**, left then right, described as deep and difficult to localize
- Frequently wakes in the **early morning hours** due to stiffness
- NSAIDs provide noticeable relief

### Relevant Medical History
- Reports a prior episode of **eye redness and pain** diagnosed as uveitis
- Family history of inflammatory joint disease
- No known trauma
- Denies numbness, tingling, or bowel/bladder changes

## Objective Examination

### Spine ROM

| Motion                  | Normal | Actual               | Notes                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Lumbar Flexion          | 60°+   | 45°                  | Mild stiffness                                |
| Lumbar Extension        | 25°    | **5°**               | **Severely limited**                          |
| Lumbar Sidebend Left    | 25°    | **10°**              | Stiff, firm end-feel                          |
| Lumbar Sidebend Right   | 25°    | **10°**              | Stiff, firm end-feel                          |
| Thoracic Extension      | 20°    | **5°**               | Markedly restricted                           |

**Pattern observed:**
- Disproportionate loss of **lumbar and thoracic extension**
- Global spinal stiffness without directional preference
- Non-capsular pattern involving the **axial skeleton**

**Visible impairment:**
- **En bloc movement** of trunk and pelvis
- Minimal segmental dissociation
- Hesitant spinal extension
- Reduced trunk rotation during gait

### MMT

| Muscle Group        | Strength | Notes                                      |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Trunk Extensors     | **4+/5** | Limited by stiffness, not true weakness    |
| Hip Flexors         | 5/5      | Normal                                     |
| Hip Abductors       | 5/5      | Normal                                     |
| Lower Extremity MMT | 5/5      | No focal weakness                          |

---

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Sensation intact throughout lower extremities
- Reflexes symmetric and normal
- No upper or lower motor neuron signs

---

## Case Clues
- **Young age of onset**
- **Insidious progression** over months to years
- **Morning stiffness > 90 minutes**
- Symptoms **improve with activity** and worsen with rest
- **Alternating buttock pain** consistent with sacroiliac joint involvement
- Marked **lumbar and thoracic extension loss**
- History of **uveitis**
- Absence of neurologic findings

---

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Lumbar extension** to **5°**
  - **Thoracic extension** to **5°**
  - **Lumbar side bending** to **10° bilaterally**
- Apply spine collision override
- Student observes:
  - En bloc spinal movement
  - Global axial stiffness
  - Avoidance of extension

---

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **5° lumbar extension**
  - **5° thoracic extension**
  - **10° lumbar side bending bilaterally**
- Student documents inflammatory pattern rather than capsular joint restriction

---

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Trunk extensors** at **4+/5**
- Emphasis:
  - Strength largely preserved
  - Functional limitation driven by stiffness and inflammation

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads case to unlock modules
2. Observes axial stiffness and en bloc spinal movement in Motion Lab
3. Measures severely limited spinal extension in Goniometry Trainer
4. Records largely preserved strength in MMT Trainer
5. Identifies **suspected Ankylosing Spondylitis** and selects **medical referral for rheumatologic evaluation**
