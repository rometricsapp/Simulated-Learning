# Case 6: Inflammatory Knee Disorder

## Patient Profile
- Name: Linda S.
- Age: 46
- Sex: Female
- Occupation: Office administrator

---

## Chief Complaint
“Both of my knees feel stiff and swollen, especially in the mornings, and it takes a long time before I can move comfortably.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **gradual**, beginning approximately **6–8 months ago**
- No specific injury or trauma
- Symptoms initially intermittent, now persistent
- Primary complaints:
  - Knee **stiffness**, swelling, and aching pain (4–6/10)
  - **Morning stiffness lasting over 60 minutes**
  - Difficulty with prolonged standing, stairs, and sit-to-stand
- Symptoms:
  - Improve somewhat with **gentle movement**
  - Worsen with **inactivity or prolonged sitting**
- Reports increased fatigue over the last several months
- NSAIDs provide partial, temporary relief

### Relevant Medical History
- Reports a close family member with long-standing joint swelling and morning stiffness
- Reports intermittent swelling in hands and wrists
- No history of joint locking, catching, or instability
- Denies numbness, tingling, or low back pain

## Objective Examination

### Knee ROM

| Motion            | Normal | Right Actual | Left Actual | Notes                                  |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Knee Flexion      | 135°   | **90°**      | 105°        | Pain and stiffness, right > left       |
| Knee Extension    | 0°     | **-10°**     | -5°         | Lacks terminal extension bilaterally   |

**Pattern observed:**
- **Capsular pattern**: Flexion limitation greater than extension loss
- Bilateral involvement with right knee more affected

**Visible impairment:**
- Mild joint effusion
- Slow, cautious sit-to-stand
- Difficulty descending stairs

### MMT

| Muscle Group                  | Right Strength | Left Strength | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Knee Extensors (Quadriceps)   | **4-/5**       | 4+/5          | Inhibited by pain and swelling             |
| Knee Flexors (Hamstrings)     | 4+/5           | 5/5           | Mild weakness on right                     |
| Hip Abductors                 | 5/5            | 5/5           | Normal                                     |
| Hip Extensors                 | 5/5            | 5/5           | Normal                                     |

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Sensation intact bilaterally
- Reflexes symmetric and normal
- No neurologic deficits

---

## Case Clues
- **Gradual onset** without trauma
- **Prolonged morning stiffness (>60 minutes)**
- Bilateral knee involvement
- Visible joint effusion
- Capsular ROM pattern
- Systemic features (fatigue, family history, hand involvement)
- Partial response to NSAIDs

---

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Right knee flexion** to **90°**
  - **Right knee extension** to **-10°**
- Apply knee collision override
- Student observes:
  - Stiff, guarded knee motion
  - Difficulty with terminal extension
  - Functional limitations during transitional movements

---

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **90° knee flexion**
  - **-10° knee extension**
- Student documents capsular pattern and bilateral involvement

---

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Right knee extensors (quadriceps)** at **4-/5**
- Emphasis:
  - Pain- and effusion-inhibited strength rather than neurologic weakness

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads case to unlock modules
2. Observes capsular knee stiffness and effusion in Motion Lab
3. Measures restricted knee ROM in Goniometry Trainer
4. Records quadriceps inhibition in MMT Trainer
5. Identifies **suspected Rheumatoid Arthritis** and selects **medical referral for rheumatologic evaluation**
