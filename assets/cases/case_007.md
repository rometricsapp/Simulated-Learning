# Case 7:Neck Pain with Arm Weakness

## Patient Profile
- Name: Karen L.
- Age: 58
- Sex: Female
- Occupation: Part-time retail associate

## Chief Complaint
“My neck pain keeps getting worse, and now my left arm feels weak.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **gradual**, worsening over the last **3–4 months**
- No specific injury or trauma
- Pain described as deep, constant, and aching in the **cervical and upper thoracic region** (6–8/10)
- Pain is:
  - **Present at rest**
  - **Worse at night**, frequently waking her from sleep
  - **Not clearly relieved** by position or activity
- Reports increasing difficulty with:
  - Holding objects with the left hand
  - Overhead reaching
- Over-the-counter analgesics provide minimal relief

### Relevant Medical History
- History of malignancy treated several years ago and described as “in remission”
- Reports unexplained fatigue over the last several months
- Recent, unintentional weight loss
- Denies recent infection or trauma
- No bowel or bladder changes

## Objective Examination

### Cervical ROM

| Motion                | Normal | Actual              | Notes                                      |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Flexion               | 45°    | 40°                 | Mild discomfort                            |
| Extension             | 45°    | **20°**             | Painful, guarded                           |
| Rotation Left         | 70°    | **35°**             | Painful, limited                           |
| Rotation Right        | 70°    | **35°**             | Painful                                   |
| Lateral Flexion L/R   | 45°    | 30° / 30°           | Mild restriction                           |

**Pattern observed:**
- **Non-capsular ROM limitation**
- Pain not reproduced consistently at end range
- Symptoms disproportionate to mechanical findings

**Visible impairment:**
- Guarded cervical posture
- Avoidance of extension
- Minimal change in symptoms with repeated movement

### MMT

| Muscle Group                    | Strength | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Cervical Rotators (Left)        | **4-/5** | Weakness not clearly pain-limited         |
| Shoulder Abductors (Left)       | **4-/5** | Difficulty sustaining resistance          |
| Elbow Flexors / Extensors       | 4+/5    | Mild generalized weakness                 |
| Right Upper Extremity           | 5/5      | Normal                                    |

---

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Diminished light touch along left upper extremity in a **non-dermatomal distribution**
- Reflexes slightly diminished on the left
- No clear single nerve root pattern

---

## Case Clues
- **Progressive neck pain** without trauma
- **Night pain** not relieved by position
- History of **malignancy**
- Unexplained fatigue and weight loss
- **Progressive upper extremity weakness**
- Non-capsular ROM pattern
- Neurologic findings not following a single nerve root

---

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Cervical extension** to **20°**
  - **Cervical rotation** to **35° bilaterally**
- Apply cervical collision override
- Student observes:
  - Guarded cervical motion
  - Minimal symptom change with repeated movement
  - Lack of mechanical pattern

---

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **20° cervical extension**
  - **35° cervical rotation bilaterally**
- Student documents non-capsular pattern and symptom behavior

---

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Left cervical rotators** at **4-/5**
  - **Left shoulder abductors** at **4-/5**
- Emphasis:
  - Weakness not fully explained by pain or disuse

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads case to unlock modules
2. Observes non-mechanical cervical pattern in Motion Lab
3. Measures limited cervical ROM in Goniometry Trainer
4. Records unexplained upper extremity weakness in MMT Trainer
5. Identifies **suspected cervical spine metastatic disease** and selects **urgent medical referral**
