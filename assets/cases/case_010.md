# Case 10: Proximal Upper Extremity Weakness
## Patient Profile
- Name: Rachel P.
- Age: 36
- Sex: Female
- Occupation: Elementary school teacher

---

## Chief Complaint
“My arms feel weak by the end of the day, and sometimes my eyelids feel heavy.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **gradual**, over the last **4–6 months**
- No specific injury or trauma
- Primary complaint is **progressive weakness that worsens with activity**
- Weakness most noticeable:
  - At the end of the workday
  - With repetitive tasks (writing on board, lifting objects)
- Reports episodes of:
  - **Drooping eyelids**, especially in the evening
  - Difficulty sustaining overhead arm positions
- Symptoms:
  - **Improve with rest**
  - **Worsen with repeated use**
- Denies pain as a primary symptom
- Denies numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation

### Relevant Medical History
- No known neurologic disorders
- No history of trauma
- No recent infection
- Not currently on medications affecting neuromuscular function

## Objective Examination

### Upper Extremity ROM

| Motion                | Normal | Actual            | Notes                                  |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Shoulder Flexion (L)  | 180°   | **160°**          | Full initially, fatigues with reps     |
| Elbow Flexion (L)     | 150°   | **140°**          | Declines with repeated testing         |
| Shoulder Abduction    | 180°   | 170°              | Near full                              |
| Wrist / Hand ROM      | WNL    | WNL               | Normal                                 |

**Pattern observed:**
- ROM **appears near normal initially**
- Performance **declines with repetition**
- No capsular or mechanical restriction pattern

**Visible impairment:**
- Increasing difficulty maintaining arm elevation
- Subtle eyelid drooping noted during exam
- Strength visibly decreases with repeated effort

### MMT

| Muscle Group                  | Strength | Notes                                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Shoulder Abductors (Left)     | **4/5**  | Weakens with sustained resistance                   |
| Elbow Flexors (Left)          | **4/5**  | Fatigues quickly                                    |
| Hand Intrinsics               | 5/5      | Normal                                              |
| Lower Extremity Muscles       | 5/5      | Normal                                              |

---

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Sensation intact throughout
- Reflexes normal and symmetric
- No upper or lower motor neuron signs

---

## Case Clues
- **Fluctuating weakness**
- Symptoms worsen with **repeated use**
- Improvement with **rest**
- Ocular involvement (eyelid drooping)
- Normal sensation and reflexes
- Absence of pain or joint restriction

---

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Left shoulder flexion** to **160°** after repeated use
  - **Left elbow flexion** to **140°** after repeated use
- Student observes:
  - Decline in movement performance with repetition
  - No mechanical end-feel limitation

---

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **160° shoulder flexion**
  - **140° elbow flexion**
- Emphasis:
  - ROM appears normal initially but is not sustainable

---

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Left shoulder abductors** at **4/5**
  - **Left elbow flexors** at **4/5**
- Emphasis:
  - Fatigable weakness rather than pain or neurologic deficit

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads case to unlock modules
2. Observes fatigable movement pattern in Motion Lab
3. Measures near-normal but unsustainable ROM in Goniometry Trainer
4. Records fatigable weakness in MMT Trainer
5. Identifies **suspected Myasthenia Gravis** and selects **medical referral for neurologic evaluation**
