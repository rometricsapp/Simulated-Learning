# Case 3: Cluster Impairment 

## Patient Profile
- Name: Tania K.
- Age: 42
- Occupation: Accountant (desk job)

---

## Chief Complaint
“My low back pain came on suddenly and now both my legs feel weak and strange, and I’m having trouble going to the bathroom.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **4 days ago**, after lifting a heavy box from the floor  
- Initially felt a sharp pain in the **central low back**, now:
- Constant, deep ache in **lumbosacral region**, 7–8/10  
- Pain **does NOT change** much with position (standing, sitting, lying)  
- New symptoms in the last **24–48 hours**:
- **Bilateral leg weakness**, especially when trying to lift the front of her feet  
- Describes **“numbness in the groin/saddle area”**  
- Reports **difficulty starting urination** and a feeling of incomplete emptying  
- No previous history of significant back pain  
- Denies recent trauma beyond the lift, but:
- Woke up last night multiple times because pain would not let her sleep  
- No fever, but appears **visibly distressed and worried**

## Objective Examination

### Lumbar ROM (standing)

| Motion            | Normal Approx.                | Actual                | Notes                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Lumbar Flexion    | 60°+ (fingers to ankles/toes) | **20°** (severe pain) | Guarded, very stiff, pain unchanged by repetition |
| Lumbar Extension  | 25°                           | **5°** (severe pain)  | Marked limitation                                 |
| Lateral Flexion R | 25°                           | 15°                   | Mild loss, pain central                           |
| Lateral Flexion L | 25°                           | 15°                   | Mild loss, pain central                           |
| Rotation R/L      | 30°                           | 20° each              | Pain, but less provocative                        |

**Visible impairment:**
- Moves **very slowly** and guarded in all planes  
- Uses her hands on thighs for any attempt at flexion  
- Facial grimacing with small movements; **no clear mechanical “position of relief”**

### MMT (Lower Extremity Key Groups)

| Muscle Group / Test                | Right Strength | Left Strength | Notes                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Hip Flexors                        | 4-/5           | 4-/5          | Pain in back, but can resist mildly   |
| Knee Extensors (Quadriceps)        | 4/5            | 4/5           | Slightly reduced, symmetrical         |
| Ankle Dorsiflexors (Tibialis Ant.) | **3-/5**       | **3-/5**      | Bilateral weakness, “feet feel heavy” |
| Ankle Plantarflexors               | 4-/5           | 4-/5          | Slight weakness, symmetric            |
| Great Toe Extension                | **3-/5**       | **3-/5**      | Difficulty holding against resistance |

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Light touch:
  - **Decreased sensation in perianal / saddle region (S3–S5)**  
  - Diminished along **posterior thighs** bilaterally  
- Reflexes:
  - Patellar reflexes: 1+ (reduced) bilaterally  
  - Achilles reflexes: **0–1+** (markedly reduced/absent) bilaterally  
- Reports **numbness/tingling in inner thighs and perineal region**  

---

## Case Clues
- **Severe, constant low back pain** not clearly mechanical  
- **Marked lumbar ROM loss** in flexion and extension  
- **Bilateral leg weakness**, especially distal (ankle DF, great toe extension)  
- **Saddle anesthesia / altered perineal sensation**  
- New onset **bladder dysfunction (difficulty initiating urination)**  
- Combination of symptoms strongly suggestive of **cauda equina involvement → EMERGENT REFERRAL**

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Lumbar flexion** to **20°**  
  - **Lumbar extension** to **5°**  
- Visual behavior:
  - Show patient model moving **very stiffly** in the lumbar spine  
  - Use **slow, guarded movement** with visible discomfort cues  
- Goal for the student:
  - Recognize that although ROM is limited, the **pattern of pain + neuro findings is more concerning than the ROM numbers themselves**.  

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **20° lumbar flexion**  
  - **5° lumbar extension**  
- Student documents:
  - Limited lumbar ROM but is prompted (by case text) to consider that **ROM findings alone do not explain severity + neuro signs**.  

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Bilateral ankle dorsiflexors** at **3-/5**  
- Other MMT groups:
  - Slightly reduced but not grossly asymmetric (4-/5 to 4/5)  
- Intent:
  - Make **distal bilateral weakness** clear, especially in dorsiflexors and great toe extension.  

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads the full case to unlock modules.  
2. In **Motion Lab**, observes:
   - Markedly limited lumbar ROM with stiff, guarded movement.  
3. In **Goniometry Trainer**, measures and records:
   - **20° lumbar flexion**  
   - **5° lumbar extension**  
4. In **MMT Trainer**, records:
   - **Bilateral ankle dorsiflexors = 3-/5**, with additional mild generalized LE weakness.  
5. **Critical step:**
   - Identifies the cluster of red flags (saddle anesthesia, bilateral distal weakness, bladder changes) and **chooses “Refer for urgent medical evaluation (suspected cauda equina)”** rather than proceeding with conservative PT plan.
