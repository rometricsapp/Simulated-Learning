# Case 9: Axial Thoracic Pain

## Patient Profile
- Name: Margaret H.
- Age: 69
- Sex: Female
- Occupation: Retired school teacher

---

## Chief Complaint
“I have sharp pain in the middle of my back, especially when I move or take a deep breath.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **2 weeks ago**, following a **minor household incident** (bending to lift a light object)
- No fall or direct trauma reported
- Pain located in the **mid-thoracic region**
- Pain described as **sharp and deep** (6–8/10)
- Symptoms are:
  - Worse with **movement**, especially extension
  - Increased with **coughing, sneezing, or deep breathing**
  - Present at rest, with intermittent spikes
- Difficulty sleeping due to pain
- Denies radiation into the arms or legs

### Relevant Medical History
- History of **osteoporosis**
- Long-term **corticosteroid use** for inflammatory condition
- No prior thoracic spine injuries
- Denies fever, recent infection, or neurologic symptoms

---

## Objective Examination

### Thoracic Spine ROM

| Motion               | Normal | Actual              | Notes                                       |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Thoracic Flexion     | 40°    | **30°**             | Painful                                    |
| Thoracic Extension   | 20°    | **5°**              | **Severely limited**, pain reproduced       |
| Thoracic Rotation L  | 35°    | **20°**             | Painful                                    |
| Thoracic Rotation R  | 35°    | **20°**             | Painful                                    |

**Pattern observed:**
- ROM limitations **do not follow a capsular pattern**
- Extension most provocative and limited

**Visible impairment:**
- Guarded thoracic posture
- Avoidance of spinal extension
- Shallow breathing pattern

### MMT

| Muscle Group         | Strength | Notes                                     |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Thoracic Extensors   | **4+/5** | Limited by pain, not true weakness        |
| Abdominals           | 5/5      | Normal                                    |
| Upper Extremity MMT  | 5/5      | Normal                                    |
| Lower Extremity MMT  | 5/5      | Normal                                    |

---

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Sensation intact in trunk and extremities
- Reflexes symmetric and normal
- No upper or lower motor neuron signs

---

## Case Clues
- Acute onset following **minimal load**
- **Midline thoracic pain**
- Pain with coughing, sneezing, and deep breathing
- History of **osteoporosis and steroid use**
- Severe limitation of thoracic extension
- Normal neurologic examination

---

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Thoracic flexion** to **30°**
  - **Thoracic extension** to **5°**
  - **Thoracic rotation** to **20° bilaterally**
- Apply thoracic collision override
- Student observes:
  - Guarded thoracic movement
  - Pain reproduced with extension
  - Shallow breathing pattern

---

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **30° thoracic flexion**
  - **5° thoracic extension**
  - **20° thoracic rotation bilaterally**
- Student documents non-capsular ROM limitation

---

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Thoracic extensors** at **4+/5**
- Emphasis:
  - Strength limited by pain rather than neurologic deficit

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads case to unlock modules
2. Observes pain-dominant thoracic movement in Motion Lab
3. Measures restricted thoracic ROM in Goniometry Trainer
4. Records pain-limited thoracic extensor strength in MMT Trainer
5. Identifies **suspected thoracic vertebral compression fracture** and selects **urgent medical referral for imaging**
