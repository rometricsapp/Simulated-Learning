# Case 8: Persistent Ankle Pain

## Patient Profile
- Name: Emily T.
- Age: 32
- Sex: Female
- Occupation: Physical therapy aide

---

## Chief Complaint
“My right ankle hurts constantly, even when I barely touch it, and it doesn’t feel like it belongs to me anymore.”

---

## History of Present Illness
- Onset **3 months ago** following a **minor right ankle sprain**
- Initial injury described as mild, with minimal swelling and no fracture
- Pain progressively worsened rather than improving
- Current pain described as **burning, throbbing, and severe** (7–9/10)
- Pain is:
  - **Out of proportion** to the original injury
  - Present at rest and with minimal movement
  - Triggered by **light touch or clothing**
- Reports increasing difficulty with walking and weight-bearing
- Symptoms have persisted despite rest, bracing, and standard rehabilitation

### Associated Symptoms
- Swelling of the right ankle and foot
- Skin color changes (reddish-purple at times)
- Temperature asymmetry (right foot feels warmer than left)
- Increased sweating around the ankle
- Stiffness and decreased use of the right foot

### Relevant Medical History
- No prior ankle injuries
- No known neurologic disorders
- Denies systemic illness or infection

## Objective Examination

### Ankle ROM (Right)

| Motion           | Normal | Actual              | Notes                                       |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Dorsiflexion     | 20°    | **5°**              | Painful, guarded                            |
| Plantarflexion   | 50°    | **25°**             | Limited by pain                             |
| Inversion        | 35°    | **10°**             | Severe pain with minimal motion             |
| Eversion         | 15°    | **5°**              | Markedly limited                            |

**Pattern observed:**
- ROM limitations **do not follow a capsular pattern**
- Pain limits motion before true end range

**Visible impairment:**
- Avoidance of weight-bearing on right lower extremity
- Protective posturing
- Guarded, hesitant movements

---

### MMT

| Muscle Group                     | Strength | Notes                                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Ankle Dorsiflexors               | **4-/5** | Limited by pain and inhibition              |
| Ankle Plantarflexors             | **4-/5** | Pain-limited                                |
| Ankle Invertors / Evertors       | 4-/5     | Poor tolerance to testing                   |
| Proximal Lower Extremity Muscles | 5/5      | Normal                                      |

---

### Sensation / Neuro Screen
- Marked **hypersensitivity** to light touch around the right ankle and foot
- Allodynia present
- Sensation otherwise intact proximally
- Reflexes normal

---

## Case Clues
- Pain **out of proportion** to original injury
- **Allodynia** and hypersensitivity
- Autonomic changes (skin color, temperature, sweating)
- ROM limited primarily by pain, not stiffness
- Motor inhibition without true neurologic weakness
- Symptoms persisting and worsening months after minor injury

---

## ROMetrics Module Instructions

### Motion Lab
- Limit:
  - **Right ankle dorsiflexion** to **5°**
  - **Right ankle plantarflexion** to **25°**
  - **Right ankle inversion** to **10°**
  - **Right ankle eversion** to **5°**
- Apply ankle collision override
- Student observes:
  - Severe pain behaviors
  - Avoidance of movement
  - Disproportionate response to minimal motion

---

### Goniometry Trainer
- Hard stops at:
  - **5° dorsiflexion**
  - **25° plantarflexion**
  - **10° inversion**
  - **5° eversion**
- Student documents non-capsular, pain-limited ROM

---

### MMT Trainer
- Cap:
  - **Right ankle dorsiflexors** at **4-/5**
  - **Right ankle plantarflexors** at **4-/5**
- Emphasis:
  - Strength inhibition due to pain rather than nerve injury

---

## Case Completion Requirements
1. Student reads case to unlock modules
2. Observes pain-dominant movement pattern in Motion Lab
3. Measures pain-limited ankle ROM in Goniometry Trainer
4. Records inhibited ankle strength in MMT Trainer
5. Identifies **suspected Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS Type I)** and selects **appropriate referral and interdisciplinary management**
