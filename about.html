    <h1>About ROMetrics</h1>
    
    <p>ROMetrics is a biomechanics and movement platform designed for learners, students, and clinicians who want a clear and accurate understanding of human movement.</p>

    <div class="feature-group">
        <span class="feature-title">Goniometry Tools</span>
        <p>ROMetrics includes goniometry tools for learning and practicing joint angle measurement using anatomically aligned models and visual reference of planes and axes of motion.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-group">
        <span class="feature-title">Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)</span>
        <p>The Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) area focuses on muscle function, positioning, and grading concepts, helping users understand how strength is assessed and documented.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-group">
        <span class="feature-title">The Motion Lab</span>
        <p>The Motion Lab provides interactive 3D visualization of joint and segment movement, allowing users to explore range of motion, movement direction, and anatomical relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-group">
        <span class="feature-title">The Forensic Motion Lab</span>
        <p>The Forensic Motion Lab supports analysis of balance, stability, and movement strategies by examining posture, center of mass, base of support, and joint sequencing to understand why movements succeed or fail.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature-group">
        <span class="feature-title">Simulated Evaluations</span>
        <p>Simulated Evaluations allow users to apply these tools in structured scenarios that mirror real assessments. Users work through movement analysis, measurement, and decision-making as part of guided or self-directed evaluations.</p>
    </div>

    <p>ROMetrics brings these areas together in a single, web-based workspace centered on accurate biomechanics, clear visualization, and applied understanding.</p>
