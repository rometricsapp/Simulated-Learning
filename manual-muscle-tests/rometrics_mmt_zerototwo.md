---

## Scapular Adduction / Retraction — Middle Trapezius, Rhomboids

### Action
Ask the patient to **draw the shoulder blade “down and in” toward the spine** while keeping the hand on the low back and the arm relaxed in your support.

- No detectable activity.

**Why the Foot Moves In vs Out with Hip External Rotation**

* **Short sitting:** the knee is bent, so when the **femur rolls outward** (external rotation), the lower leg swings and the **foot moves inward** toward midline.

* **Supine, knee straight:** the whole leg is in line, so when the **femur rolls outward**, the **foot follows and rolls outward** too.

## Hip Internal Rotation — Glute Med/Min (anterior ), Tensor Fasciae Latae
### Grade 2 — Gravity‑Minimized Position
- **Supine**, legs extended; **foot rolls inward** so the **hip rotates internally** 
### Grade 1 — Palpation
- **TFL** on the **anterior‑lateral** hip; **glute med/min anterior fibers** just anterior to greater trochanter.
- **Find‑it cue:** “Roll your toes inward; I’m feeling on the front‑outside of the hip.”
### Grade 0 — Observation
- No activity appreciated.

---

## Knee Flexion — Hamstrings
### Grade 2 — Gravity‑Minimized Position
- **Side‑lying**, test limb **uppermost**; therapist supports the **thigh and ankle**;  holding them in their hand(s) above the tabel/surface.
### Grade 1 — Palpation
- **Medial and lateral hamstring tendons** just **above the posterior knee**.
- **Find‑it cue:** “Start bending your knee; I’m feeling the tendons behind the knee.”
### Grade 0 — Observation
- No hamstring activity.
---

## Knee Extension — Quadriceps Femoris
### Grade 2 — Gravity‑Minimized Position
- **Side‑lying**, test limb **uppermost**; therapist supports limb in their hands(s) so the **knee straightens/extends**.
### Grade 1 — Palpation
- **Quadriceps tendon** above the patella or **patellar tendon** below the patella.
- **Find‑it cue:** “Straighten your knee; I’m feeling your tendon above/below the kneecap.”
### Grade 0 — Observation
- No quad activity.
---

## Foot Dorsiflexion + Inversion — Tibialis Anterior
### Grade 2 — Gravity‑Minimized Position
- Supine or short sitting, **Completes only a partial range**
### Grade 1 — Palpation
- **TA tendon** on the **anteromedial ankle** at the level of the malleoli.
- **Find‑it cue:** “Pull your foot up and in; I’m feeling the tendon toward the inside front of your ankle.”
### Grade 0 — Observation
- No TA tendon activity.
### Note:
Because the foot is light, clinicians keep the standard test position and label weakness as Grade 2 when only partial range is achieved.

## Plantar Flexion + Foot Eversion — Fibularis Longus & Brevis - Grades 0-2

### Grade 2 — Weak in Standard Test Position

* **Position:** Short sitting or supine, ankle in neutral.
* **Performance:** Attempts to turn the foot **down and out** with depression of the first metatarsal but completes **only part of the available range**.

### Grade 1 — Palpation

* **Position:** Short sitting or supine.
* **Palpation:**

  * **Fibularis longus:** Upper lateral leg just below the fibular head; tendon posterior to the lateral malleolus.
  * **Fibularis brevis:** Distal lateral leg over the fibula; tendon anterior to the lateral malleolus toward the base of the fifth metatarsal.
* **Finding:** **Trace contractile activity** or tendon prominence without visible foot motion.

### Grade 0 — No Activity

* **Position:** Short sitting or supine.
* **Finding:** **No palpable contraction** and no tendon response during the test command.


## Ankle Plantar Flexion — Gastrocnemius, Soleus (Non‑Heel‑Raise Low‑Grades)
### Grade 2 — Gravity‑Minimized Position
- **Prone** with the foot hanging off the edge of the table
- **Holds against maximum resistance.** Stands at the foot and applies resistance at the plantar surface of the forefoot as the patient holds the plantar-flexed position. Because the gastrocnemius–soleus complex is functionally very powerful, this Grade 2 (prone) test is an exception in that resistance is applied
### Grade 1 — Palpation
- *Partially completes range**
- **Gastrocnemius:** Posterior **calf** bulk.
- **Soleus:** Deep to gastroc near the **Achilles**.
- **Find‑it cue:** “Point your toes a little; I’m feeling the calf muscle and the tendon above the heel.”
### Grade 0 — Observation
- No plantarflexor activity.
