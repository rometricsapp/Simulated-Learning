### Muscles Tested

* Gluteus Medius (anterior fibers)
* Gluteus Minimus
* Tensor Fasciae Latae

### Position

* Short sitting, knee at 90°

### Therapist

* Sit or kneel beside the test leg.
* Stabilizing hand: Rest your hand on the medial (inner) thigh just above the knee to keep the femur steady.
* Resistance hand: Place your other hand on the lateral (outer) ankle just above the malleolus and push inward while the patient tries to move the lower leg outward (into hip internal rotation).

### Action

* Tell the patient to slide their lower leg out (away from the other ankle), while you push in the opposite direction, trying to bring the leg back in.

### Grades 3, 4, 5

* **Grade 5:** holds position against max resistance
* **Grade 4:** holds against moderate resistance
* **Grade 3:** full ROM against gravity, no resistance

## Knee Flexion (Hamstrings)

**Plane: sagittal | End-Feel: soft/firm**

### Muscles Tested

* Hamstrings

### Position

* Prone, knee flexed to ~45°

### Therapist

* Stabilize distal thigh

### Action

* Flex knee; resist downward at **posterior distal leg**

### Grades 3, 4, 5

* **Grade 5:** holds position against max resistance
* **Grade 4:** holds against moderate resistance
* **Grade 3:** full ROM against gravity, no resistance

## Knee Extension (Quadriceps)

**Plane: sagittal | End-Feel: firm**

### Muscles Tested

* Quadriceps Femoris

### Position

* Short sitting

### Therapist

* Stabilize anterior thigh

### Action

* Extend knee; resist downward at **anterior distal leg**

### Grades 3, 4, 5

* **Grade 5:** holds position against max resistance
* **Grade 4:** holds against moderate resistance
* **Grade 3:** full ROM against gravity, no resistance

## Foot Dorsiflexion + Inversion (Tibialis Anterior)

**Plane: sagittal + frontal | End-Feel: firm**

### Muscle Tested

* Tibialis Anterior

### Position

* **Supine** with heel on table or short sitting, foot hanging off the edge of the test table.
* Supine is often preferred because the heel is stably supported, keeping the patient relaxed while still allowing a clean, isolated tibialis anterior test. In supine slightly flex the knee to reduce gastrocnemius tension.

### Therapist

* Supine: Patient supine, heel on table. Stabilize the distal leg above the malleoli and apply resistance over the dorsomedial foot into plantarflexion/eversion (opposing dorsiflexion with inversion).

* Short sitting: Patient short sitting, foot hanging over table edge (heel may rest on therapist’s thigh for added support). Stabilize the distal leg above the malleoli and apply resistance over the dorsomedial foot into plantarflexion/eversion (opposing dorsiflexion with inversion).

### Action

* Dorsiflex + invert; resist down/out at **dorsum of foot**

### Grades 3, 4, 5

* **Grade 5:** holds position against max resistance
* **Grade 4:** holds against moderate resistance
* **Grade 3:** full ROM against gravity, no resistance

### Why Both Seated & Supine Positions Are Valid for Grades 3-5

* Tibialis anterior is the prime mover (dorsiflexion + inversion).
* The foot is not fully supported in a true gravity-eliminated plane.
* The dorsum of the foot still has to lift against gravity.
* You can apply standardized resistance in the correct line of pull (DF + inversion).

## Plantar Flexion + Foot Eversion — Fibularis Longus & Brevis

### Muscles Tested

* Fibularis longus
* Fibularis brevis

### Position

* **Short sitting,** ankle in neutral (midway between dorsiflexion and plantar flexion); may also be tested supine with ankle in neutral.
* *Short sitting is preferred because the foot moves freely in space without pressing into the table, avoiding friction and blocking of plantarflexion, and making eversion and first-metatarsal depression easier to see and resist than in supine.*


### Therapist

* Sit or stand facing the patient.
* Stabilize the distal leg just above the malleoli (avoid squeezing the distal tibia).
* Place the other hand along the dorsum and lateral border of the forefoot and apply resistance into inversion with slight dorsiflexion (up and in).

### Test

* Patient moves the foot **down and out** into eversion with plantar flexion, with depression of the first metatarsal head.

### Instructions to Patient

* “Turn your foot down and out. Hold it. Don’t let me move it in.”

### Grades 3–5

* **Grade 5:** Full range of eversion with plantar flexion, holds end position against maximal resistance.
* **Grade 4:** Full range of eversion with plantar flexion, holds against moderate resistance.
* **Grade 3:** Completes full available range of eversion with plantar flexion without resistance.


## Ankle Plantar Flexion (Gastrocnemius, Soleus)

**Plane: sagittal | End-Feel: firm**

### Muscles Tested

* Gastrocnemius
* Soleus

### Position

* Standing single-leg heel raise (knee extended). Non test leg lifted and flexed

### Therapist

* Stand to side

### Action

* Repeated heel raises to full height

### Grades 3, 4, 5

* **Grade 5:** 25 single-leg heel raises through full range
* **Grade 4:** 2–24 single-leg heel raises through full range
* **Grade 3:** 1 single-leg heel raise through full range, unable to repeat
